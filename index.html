            <p>The beginnings of Acquired Antiquities started as a childhood hobby.  I vividly remember the cold New England Saturday mornings traversing the city with my mother searching for the "Great Find".  I developed a deep
            appreciation for items of yesteryear.  Researching and discovering the history of the item is just as interesting, if, not more than, determining its collectibility value. </p>

                <p>Of all the Acquired Antiquities, the greatest is my inherited love for flying.  I am forever indebted to my late father, Tuskegee Flight Officer, Robert Otis Merriweather for encouraging me to pursue and to complete my instrument rating.
                   A native Alabamian, Robert Merriweather, attended segregated schools.  He excelled in mathematics.  Out of necessity, the Air Corp opened its doors to African American men.
                   During academic training, Mr. Merriweather's mathematical gift was recoghized.  Consequently, he was selected to participate in flight training.  We must never forget their contribution to aviation.

He commanded Admiral Richard Byrd's ship the Bear of Oakland and was a pilot on Byrd's Second Antarctic Expedition (1933 35). He was the second in command on the MacGregor Arctic Expedition (1937 38) where he accomplished a number of polar aviation firsts.
